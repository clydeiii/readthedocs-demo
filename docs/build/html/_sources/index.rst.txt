Welcome to readthedocs-demo's documentation!
============================================

This is our sample documentation.  We want to add a license to this project, so let's do that!

.. warning:: You might find this documentation too helpful.  If it helps too much, consult your doctor.  See also :rfc:`1984`

To get started with Sphinx, you must do the following commands
.. code-block:: bash
   pip install sphinx
   cd your-code-doc-dir
   sphinx-quickstart

This will stub out a structure for your rst or md files and create a makefile that sphinx will use to build your docs into html.
